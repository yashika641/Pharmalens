This design choice stems from our mission to make medicine safety accessible across India—including in rural, low-income, or underserved communities where the latest smartphones are uncommon. The core application, including OCR, drug matching, and interaction checking, is optimized to run with minimal system resources. We use lightweight AI models (e.g., Gemma 2B for slower devices and Gemma 4B for faster ones) that strike a balance between speed and accuracy. The image processing and AI interaction all happen locally, eliminating the need for cloud computation, which further reduces load time and power consumption. PharmaLens also adjusts dynamically based on device capabilities. For example, lower-end devices may use simpler image preprocessing pipelines or limit batch scanning to fewer items. Despite these adjustments, the safety and reliability of the results remain intact. Additionally, we offer a \"Lite Mode\" for extremely basic phones. This version uses fewer animations and lower resolution outputs but retains all core functionality. In short, if your phone can run WhatsApp or YouTube, it can likely run PharmaLens comfortably.

The app is built with a strong privacy-first architecture where all processing happens locally on your device . When you upload a medicine strip image, it is only used temporarily to run through the OCR (Optical Character Recognition) module and generate medicine-related insights. Once the result is displayed, the image is discarded from memory unless you explicitly choose to save it for your own offline reference. There’s no cloud sync, no image logging, and no hidden uploads in the background. Your image never leaves your phone, laptop, or whatever device you’re using. This ensures that even sensitive prescription data remains fully private and inaccessible to anyone else—including us. For advanced users who enable scan history (optional), basic drug names and safety results may be stored locally in a secure file—but never the image itself. You can clear this history at any time through the settings panel. In short, PharmaLens gives you full control. If you choose not to store anything, the app acts like a “read-only lens” into your medicine safety—private, temporary, and self-contained."}]}

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Question: How does PharmaLens identify a medicine from just an image of a pill strip?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Answer: PharmaLens uses a combination of computer vision and optical character recognition (OCR) to identify medicines from pill strip images. When a user uploads or captures an image of a medicine strip, the app first preprocesses the image to enhance clarity—this involves converting the image to grayscale, removing noise, and resizing it for better text extraction. Once the image is processed, the OCR module—powered by Tesseract or DeepOCR—reads any printed text on the strip. This text usually includes the drug name, dosage, and sometimes manufacturing details. PharmaLens then applies fuzzy matching algorithms to clean up OCR errors and match the extracted text against a local offline medicine database of commonly used drugs. After matching, the app sends this interpreted drug information to the embedded Gemma 3n model via a structured prompt like: “You scanned: Paracetamol 500 mg. What are the safe usage instructions and possible risks?” Gemma then returns plain-language responses including the medicine’s use case, correct dosage, misuse risks, and interaction warnings. This entire process is performed offline , making it usable in remote areas without internet access, and ensuring user data stays private. In summary, PharmaLens doesn't just read the label—it understands it using smart OCR, drug matching, and an on-device AI assistant trained for medicine safety."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Can I ask follow-up questions to the chatbot?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yes, the PharmaLens chatbot supports follow-up questions in a natural, conversational flow. Once you receive an initial response—for example, about a drug’s purpose or dosage—you can continue the conversation with related queries, and the chatbot will understand the context.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "8. How does PharmaLens handle generic vs. brand names?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Answer: PharmaLens understands that many medicines are sold under different brand names, even though they contain the same active ingredients. To solve this, the app maintains an internal mapping between brand names (e.g., “Calpol”) and their corresponding generic drugs (e.g., “Paracetamol”). When you scan a label or type a drug name, PharmaLens cross-checks it with both brand and generic entries in its local database. If you enter or scan a brand name, the app automatically links it to its generic counterpart and runs all safety checks based on that. This helps eliminate confusion and ensures that risk warnings are accurate and consistent. This feature is particularly useful in India where the same drug can be sold by dozens of companies under slightly different brand names. It also helps users understand what they’re actually taking, especially when switching between pharmacies. Future updates will allow users to search by manufacturer, filter by category, and see all equivalent brand-generic pairs. With this brand-to-generic conversion, PharmaLens becomes not just a safety checker—but also an educational tool for smarter healthcare choices."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Can I batch scan multiple pills together?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yes! PharmaLens allows you to scan multiple pill strips in a single photo.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How often is the medicine database updated?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Answer: PharmaLens relies on a carefully curated offline medicine database that is updated regularly to include the most current formulations, safety alerts, and drug interactions. While the AI and core logic run entirely offline, the drug information files (e.g., JSON or SQLite format) are bundled with each app update. Typically, this happens every few weeks or monthly—depending on new drugs entering the market, regulatory changes, or flagged interactions by medical bodies. Updating the database ensures users have access to accurate information regarding dosage limits, new side effect findings, and brand-generic mappings. For example, if a new antibiotic becomes widely used or a combination drug is recalled, these changes are reflected in the next version’s offline data package. Users do not need internet access to check for updates. They can either update the app through their usual app store or sideload the new database manually if using an offline APK. In future versions, we aim to provide “modular” drug data packs so users can download updates specific to their region or specialty (like pediatric drugs or chronic illness kits). This offline update mechanism ensures that PharmaLens continues to offer world-class drug safety—even in areas where connectivity is poor, unpredictable, or non-existent. It also means the AI remains reliable over time, helping prevent errors from outdated references."}]}

After the OCR (optical character recognition) engine extracts text from your uploaded or captured image, the result is shown to you for review. If you notice a mistake—like a misspelled drug name, dosage error, or unreadable output—you can simply tap the 'Edit' or 'Try Again' option. PharmaLens allows users to manually correct the medicine name using the keyboard. It also provides real-time suggestions using fuzzy matching algorithms, which try to guess the intended medicine name even when the OCR result is partially wrong. For example, if the OCR misreads ‘Ciprofloxacin’ as ‘Ciproflocin,’ the app can still identify it correctly and fetch relevant safety data. In case of frequent OCR failures, the app suggests steps like improving lighting, avoiding glare, straightening the strip, or using a higher-resolution camera. There’s no need for advanced camera skills—the system is optimized for real-world conditions like poor lighting or torn packaging. This fallback workflow ensures that OCR accuracy issues never block your ability to access essential drug safety information. The experience remains intuitive and reliable, even for non-technical users in high-pressure healthcare scenarios."}]}

After the OCR engine extracts the raw text from a medicine strip—such as “Paracetmol 500mg”—the app doesn't just assume it's correct. Instead, it uses fuzzy string matching algorithms like Levenshtein distance to compare the scanned name with known entries in its drug database. The database, stored as a JSON or SQLite file, includes a curated list of commonly used medicines along with their dosage, usage, interactions, and warnings. This means that even if the OCR result is slightly incorrect or misspelled, PharmaLens can still recognize the intended medicine. For example, if the text says \"Paracetmal,\" the fuzzy matcher will correctly suggest \"Paracetamol\" and pull in the relevant data. This intelligent mapping allows the system to function reliably even with imperfect image inputs. It also helps in disambiguating similar-sounding drugs or generic versus brand name recognition , which is critical in avoiding misuse. The real strength of PharmaLens lies in combining this smart matching with the reasoning capabilities of Gemma 3n, which processes the final medicine name and delivers usage instructions, risks, and warnings—all without relying on internet or cloud services."}]}

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Question: What model is used for the chatbot?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Answer: The chatbot in PharmaLens is powered by Gemma 3n , a compact, on-device large language model (LLM) deployed using the Ollama framework . Gemma 3n is capable of reasoning over structured prompts to provide drug safety insights, misuse warnings, and dosage clarifications—all without requiring an internet connection. The version used in PharmaLens is optimized for lightweight offline deployment , often using Gemma 2B or 4B depending on device resources. This allows the chatbot to work even on low- to mid-range smartphones and laptops. The model is accessed through a backend wrapper that takes structured inputs—like drug name, dosage, user history, and possible interactions—and crafts a natural-language prompt for the LLM. Example prompt: “You scanned: Ibuprofen 400mg. Age: 70. History: Stomach ulcers. Is this safe? What are the dosage and risks?” This combination of local prompt logic, embedded domain knowledge (via your JSON database), and Gemma’s language understanding makes the chatbot a powerful yet private assistant for medication-related queries. It’s not just a search engine—it’s an AI designed for decision support, entirely offline."}]}

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "3. What should I do if the OCR result is incorrect?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Answer: If PharmaLens produces an incorrect result while scanning a medicine label or strip, there’s no need to worry—the app includes a built-in recovery mechanism to handle such cases smoothly. After the OCR (optical character recognition) engine extracts text from your uploaded or captured image, the result is shown to you for review. If you notice a mistake—like a misspelled drug name, dosage error, or unreadable output—you can simply tap the 'Edit' or 'Try Again' option. PharmaLens allows users to manually correct the medicine name using the keyboard. It also provides real-time suggestions using fuzzy matching algorithms, which try to guess the intended medicine name even when the OCR result is partially wrong. For example, if the OCR misreads ‘Ciprofloxacin’ as ‘Ciproflocin,’ the app can still identify it correctly and fetch relevant safety data. In case of frequent OCR failures, the app suggests steps like improving lighting, avoiding glare, straightening the strip, or using a higher-resolution camera. There’s no need for advanced camera skills—the system is optimized for real-world conditions like poor lighting or torn packaging. This fallback workflow ensures that OCR accuracy issues never block your ability to access essential drug safety information. The experience remains intuitive and reliable, even for non-technical users in high-pressure healthcare scenarios."}]}

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Question: Can PharmaLens match OCR results with real-world drug data?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Answer: Yes, PharmaLens is specifically designed to match OCR output with real-world drug data using a local offline medicine database and smart matching logic . After the OCR engine extracts the raw text from a medicine strip—such as “Paracetmol 500mg”—the app doesn't just assume it's correct. Instead, it uses fuzzy string matching algorithms like Levenshtein distance to compare the scanned name with known entries in its drug database. The database, stored as a JSON or SQLite file, includes a curated list of commonly used medicines along with their dosage, usage, interactions, and warnings. This means that even if the OCR result is slightly incorrect or misspelled, PharmaLens can still recognize the intended medicine. For example, if the text says \"Paracetmal,\" the fuzzy matcher will correctly suggest \"Paracetamol\" and pull in the relevant data. This intelligent mapping allows the system to function reliably even with imperfect image inputs. It also helps in disambiguating similar-sounding drugs or generic versus brand name recognition , which is critical in avoiding misuse. The real strength of PharmaLens lies in combining this smart matching with the reasoning capabilities of Gemma 3n, which processes the final medicine name and delivers usage instructions, risks, and warnings—all without relying on internet or cloud services."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Does PharmaLens detect dosage errors?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Answer: Yes, PharmaLens includes logic to detect potential dosage issues based on the scanned or typed medicine label. If you enter or scan a dosage that appears too high or too low for a standard adult, child, or elderly user, the app will raise a yellow or red flag depending on the severity. For example, if a label says “Paracetamol 1000mg 3 times a day,” PharmaLens may warn you that the total daily dosage exceeds the typical safe limit. Similarly, if you enter “Amoxicillin 125mg for an adult,” the app may suggest confirming the dosage, as it appears low for a typical adult treatment course. These alerts are based on general-purpose dosing guidelines sourced from publicly available medical literature and drug databases. They're meant to serve as a pre-check —not a substitute for professional advice. The system is especially helpful for parents administering pediatric doses or elderly patients managing multiple medications. In such cases, incorrect dosages can have serious consequences, and a simple nudge from the app can make all the difference. In future versions, PharmaLens will allow users to input age, weight, and other factors to get more personalized dose guidance. But even in its current form, the app is a powerful checkpoint for avoiding everyday medication mistakes."}]}

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Can PharmaLens identify herbal or Ayurvedic medicines?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Answer: Currently, PharmaLens is primarily focused on allopathic (Western) medicines, but support for herbal, Ayurvedic, and traditional medicines is in the roadmap. Many herbal and OTC products are sold with minimal labeling, inconsistent branding, and variable ingredients—making reliable detection more complex. That said, if an herbal product has a printed label with ingredient names (like “Ashwagandha” or “Brahmi extract”), PharmaLens can still run OCR and allow the user to read or research those components manually. In some cases, the app may offer general information about that herb if it's part of the extended safety dataset. We recognize that a large portion of the Indian population uses herbal products alongside standard medicine. That’s why our team is working to create a curated herbal interaction database—so PharmaLens can soon warn about risky combinations like “Turmeric + Warfarin” or “Ginseng + Antidepressants.” In future updates, expect dedicated support for Ayurvedic products, herbal kits, and cross-system safety guidance. Until then, users can still scan the label, manually input ingredients, and read warnings for those that are already cataloged."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Question: What happens after I upload an image?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Answer: Once you upload or capture an image on PharmaLens, the app activates its smart medicine analysis pipeline—completely offline and on-device. First, the system uses an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) engine—either Tesseract or DeepOCR—to extract text from the image. This includes detecting the medicine name, dosage, manufacturer, and expiry date printed on the strip or label. Next, the extracted text is passed through a fuzzy matching system that corrects minor spelling errors or low-confidence readings (for example, “Paracetmal” is auto-corrected to “Paracetamol”). It then matches the drug name with a local database of commonly used medications stored in JSON or SQLite format. Once a valid match is found, the medicine details are fed into the Gemma 3n model via a prompt specifically designed to query drug safety, dosage guidelines, possible misuse scenarios, and known interactions. Gemma responds with a human-readable, plain-English safety summary, which is then displayed to the user as a traffic-light style alert : ✅ Safe, ⚠ Caution, or ❌ Danger.

Here’s how it works: When a user scans or inputs a medicine, PharmaLens not only identifies the drug and its dosage but also keeps track of previously scanned or logged medicines (stored locally). Then, the app checks for potential conflicts by referencing an offline interaction matrix —a curated dataset that lists known risky drug combinations, such as “Paracetamol + Alcohol” or “Ibuprofen + Aspirin.” If a scanned drug matches an entry in this matrix, the app flags it with a warning. But the real strength comes from the AI layer. PharmaLens prompts Gemma 3n with a structured query like: “The user is taking Drug A and Drug B. Are there any risks or contraindications?” Gemma responds with plain-language advice based on known pharmacological behavior, side effects, and user conditions (e.g., liver disease, elderly age). The interaction logic is displayed to the user using a color-coded warning system: ● ✅ Safe ● ⚠ Caution ● ❌ Dangerous This dual approach—local rule-checking + AI interpretation—ensures both speed and depth. It gives users accurate interaction feedback even offline, while accounting for real-world complexities like age or health history, making PharmaLens a trusted safety companion."}]}

What if a medicine is not found in the database?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Answer: If a medicine you scan or search is not found in the PharmaLens database, the app will let you know with a friendly message such as: “This medicine could not be matched with our records.” Rather than ending the process there, PharmaLens gives you a few helpful options to still make use of the tool. First, you’ll be prompted to check the spelling and try manual input—this is useful in case the OCR misread the label. If it's a new or uncommon brand, the app might ask if you want to associate it with a known generic medicine. This helps in cases where a newer brand is just a variation of an existing drug. PharmaLens also allows users to submit unknown medicine names to a pending review list (offline for now, but cloud support is planned), which helps our team improve the database over time. As more users report rare or new entries, they will be added to the next update. In the meantime, users can manually enter known components or ingredients from the packaging to get partial safety reports. Even if full details aren't available, the system still tries to offer guidance based on what’s entered. So, even if a medicine isn't recognized immediately, PharmaLens doesn't leave you hanging.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Question: What data was used to train the chatbot?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Answer: The core model behind the PharmaLens chatbot—Gemma 3n—was pre-trained by Google using a mix of public domain datasets , scientific text corpora , and medically relevant language patterns . However, PharmaLens does not rely on the base model alone. It enhances accuracy and context relevance through custom prompt engineering and an offline drug knowledge base created specifically for the app. Here’s how the chatbot becomes domain-aware: ● 📘 Local Drug Database : Includes structured details on ~50–100 essential medicines, their uses, interactions, and warnings. ● 💬 Prompt Templates : Custom-crafted questions like: “Given drug X and condition Y, what are the safety concerns?” ● 🔄 Few-shot examples : Used during fine-tuning or prompt boosting, e.g., comparing safe vs. unsafe drug pairings. No personal user data is used to train the chatbot. All logic for understanding user input—like fuzzy drug name matching, dosage extraction, or health condition flags—is handled locally through scripts that craft intelligent prompts. So while Gemma 3n provides the language intelligence, PharmaLens augments it with real-world, medical-use-case awareness—without the need to train or fine-tune on sensitive user data."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "4. Can I batch scan multiple pills together?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yes! PharmaLens allows you to scan multiple pill strips in a single photo. It analyzes each label individually, extracts multiple drug names, and provides a combined report. It even checks for interactions between all the detected medicines—making it useful for caregivers or clinics handling many prescriptions."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How accurate is the OCR model in detecting medicine names?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "PharmaLens uses a robust OCR engine—either Tesseract or DeepOCR —combined with image preprocessing techniques to detect medicine names with a high degree of accuracy in real-world conditions. Before OCR is even applied, the app enhances the image using methods like grayscale conversion, thresholding, and resizing, which dramatically improve the clarity of printed text even from low-quality images or dimly lit environments. The OCR engine is trained to focus on structured label formats typically found on blister strips and packaging. It performs especially well when the medicine name is printed in standard fonts. Even when there are small misreads—like confusing \"0\" with \"O\"—PharmaLens applies fuzzy matching and spelling correction algorithms to identify the most likely correct drug name from the offline database. While no OCR system is 100% perfect, especially with damaged or very blurry labels, PharmaLens is engineered to work in challenging environments with constrained hardware. In internal testing, accuracy for printed medicine names exceeded 90% , with further improvements from the fuzzy matcher bringing it close to real-world usability. Additionally, the app offers a rescan option and drug confirmation prompt, allowing users to double-check or override suggestions if needed—ensuring safety always comes first."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What model is used for the chatbot?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The chatbot in PharmaLens is powered by Gemma 3n , a compact, on-device large language model (LLM) deployed using the Ollama framework . Gemma 3n is capable of reasoning over structured prompts to provide drug safety insights, misuse warnings, and dosage clarifications—all without requiring an internet connection. The version used in PharmaLens is optimized for lightweight offline deployment , often using Gemma 2B or 4B depending on device resources. This allows the chatbot to work even on low- to mid-range smartphones and laptops. The model is accessed through a backend wrapper that takes structured inputs—like drug name, dosage, user history, and possible interactions—and crafts a natural-language prompt for the LLM. Example prompt: “You scanned: Ibuprofen 400mg. Age: 70. History: Stomach ulcers. Is this safe? What are the dosage and risks?” This combination of local prompt logic, embedded domain knowledge (via your JSON database), and Gemma’s language understanding makes the chatbot a powerful yet private assistant for medication-related queries. It’s not just a search engine—it’s an AI designed for decision support, entirely offline."}]}

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "20. Can PharmaLens check for drug interactions?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Answer: Yes, checking for drug-drug interactions is one of PharmaLens' core features. When you scan multiple medicines together—either in one batch or one by one—the system not only identifies each drug but also analyzes how they may interact with one another inside the body. These interactions are flagged based on known conflict pairs in its offline safety rules database. For instance, if you scan both “Paracetamol” and “Ibuprofen,” the app will likely say it’s okay in limited doses. But if you scan “Warfarin” and “Aspirin,” the system may raise a red alert due to bleeding risks. Interaction warnings are color-coded for clarity: green (safe), yellow (use caution), and red (dangerous). The explanation includes what type of interaction is expected—like overlapping side effects, metabolic interference, or increased toxicity. This feature is particularly useful for patients with chronic conditions who take multiple drugs daily. It can also help avoid unnecessary visits to a doctor for basic cross-checking. Even over-the-counter drugs are included in the interaction system, making it helpful for self-medicating users too. And remember—this all works offline. No data is sent to a server, and no internet is needed for interaction analysis. You get safety at your fingertips, in real-time."}]}

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What if I scan a damaged or partially torn label?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Answer: If you scan a damaged, torn, or faded label, PharmaLens applies advanced image preprocessing techniques to salvage as much information as possible. The app enhances the input image using filters like grayscale conversion, noise removal, brightness correction, and thresholding. These techniques help make faint text more legible to the OCR system. Once the image is processed, the app attempts to extract medicine names and dosages from the visible sections. If parts of the text are missing or distorted, PharmaLens uses fuzzy string matching against its local drug database to suggest the most likely matches. For instance, if only “Para…” is detected, it may suggest “Paracetamol” as a potential match. You also have the option to manually fill in missing details or correct partial outputs. This hybrid approach ensures that users aren’t blocked by imperfect conditions—such as when labels get wet, scratched, or folded. PharmaLens is built for real-world use, not lab conditions. It understands that most medicine packages won't be scanned in perfect lighting or straight alignment. Its intelligent recovery mechanisms ensure users still get meaningful, safe, and actionable insights—even from less-than-perfect scans."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Question: What makes PharmaLens different from other apps?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Answer: PharmaLens stands out from other medicine or health apps in three key ways: offline functionality , AI-powered safety checks , and privacy-by-design architecture . 1. 🔌 Fully Offline : Unlike most apps that require internet access to search databases or run AI models, PharmaLens performs everything—image scanning, drug matching, and safety analysis—entirely offline. This makes it ideal for rural, remote, or emergency settings where connectivity is limited or non-existent. 2. 🧠 Gemma 3n Integration : The app uses a locally hosted large language model (LLM), Gemma 3n, to interpret drug information in plain English. It not only tells you what a medicine is for but warns about dosage risks, misuse, and interactions with other drugs you’ve scanned. 3. 🔒 Privacy-First Approach : There’s no registration, no cloud uploads, and no tracking. Your data stays on your device, and no one—including the developers—can see your scans.

How does PharmaLens assist visually impaired users?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Answer: PharmaLens is designed with accessibility at its core, and this includes thoughtful support for users who are visually impaired. Recognizing that many users—especially elderly individuals or patients in rural settings—may struggle with vision, the app offers a range of features tailored to make medicine scanning and safety evaluation easier. First, the interface supports high-contrast themes and large, easy-to-read fonts. Users can increase the font size directly in the app’s accessibility settings. This makes reading results easier even on small or outdated devices. Next, the voice assistant allows users to speak medicine names instead of typing or scanning them. This is particularly helpful for those who have trouble navigating their device’s camera or keyboard. Once the input is processed, the assistant reads the results back aloud. PharmaLens also integrates text-to-speech feedback. After detecting a medicine, the app can read out the dosage, warnings, and AI-generated interaction flags. This is especially useful for those with low literacy or for users who prefer audio-based guidance. Furthermore, PharmaLens is compatible with Android screen readers like TalkBack. Future versions aim to expand this further by including regional language support, spoken explanations of AI alerts, and gesture-based navigation modes. Together, these features ensure visually impaired users can use PharmaLens safely, independently, and confidently—without needing to rely on someone else to interpret their medications for them."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "4. Can I batch scan multiple pills together?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Answer: Yes, PharmaLens supports batch scanning, which means you can scan multiple pill strips or medicine boxes in a single image. This feature is especially useful for caregivers, hospital staff, or anyone managing several medications at once. When you upload or capture an image with multiple medicine labels, the system intelligently segments the image and extracts text from each distinct label area using multi-region OCR. Once it has identified all visible drug names, PharmaLens processes each one through its internal database and AI model. You receive an individual safety report for each medicine as well as an overall drug-drug interaction report across all the scanned items. This helps users avoid dangerous combinations and better understand potential side effects from taking multiple drugs together.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "24. Can PharmaLens identify herbal or Ayurvedic medicines?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Answer: Currently, PharmaLens is primarily focused on allopathic (Western) medicines, but support for herbal, Ayurvedic, and traditional medicines is in the roadmap. Many herbal and OTC products are sold with minimal labeling, inconsistent branding, and variable ingredients—making reliable detection more complex. That said, if an herbal product has a printed label with ingredient names (like “Ashwagandha” or “Brahmi extract”), PharmaLens can still run OCR and allow the user to read or research those components manually. In some cases, the app may offer general information about that herb if it's part of the extended safety dataset. We recognize that a large portion of the Indian population uses herbal products alongside standard medicine. That’s why our team is working to create a curated herbal interaction database—so PharmaLens can soon warn about risky combinations like “Turmeric + Warfarin” or “Ginseng + Antidepressants.” In future updates, expect dedicated support for Ayurvedic products, herbal kits, and cross-system safety guidance.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How does PharmaLens ensure user privacy?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "PharmaLens ensures user privacy by following a zero-data, offline-by-design approach from start to finish. Unlike typical mobile health apps that rely on cloud APIs, registration, or device analytics, PharmaLens performs all operations—OCR, drug matching, safety checks, and AI prompts— locally on your device. Here’s how it safeguards your privacy: ● 🔒 No Login Required : You never have to create an account or provide any personal information. ● 🧠 Local AI Processing : The embedded Gemma 3n model runs entirely offline via Ollama, so your data never leaves your phone. ● 🗃 No Cloud Storage : Uploaded images are processed in RAM and never saved unless you explicitly choose to. ● 🚫 No Ads, No Tracking : There are no third-party SDKs, trackers, or behavioral analytics tools embedded. Even optional features like scan history are stored in a secure, local file and can be wiped at any time through the app settings. No part of your interaction is used for training, profiling, or monetization. This architecture is especially important for users in rural or public health settings where shared devices are common and internet access is inconsistent. By keeping everything self-contained, PharmaLens not only improves accessibility—it makes trust and safety a core part of its design."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What if a medicine is not found in the database?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "If a medicine scanned through PharmaLens is not found in the local database, the app will gracefully handle the case by informing the user that the drug is unrecognized and offering next steps. The system is designed to never leave the user guessing or at risk. First, if the OCR result does not match any entries in the local database (even after fuzzy matching), the app will return a message like: “This medicine is not in our local database. Please double-check the image or try scanning again.” The user will then be given options to: ● 🔁 Rescan the image , in case of OCR error. ● 📝 Manually enter the drug name , for advanced users. ● 📤 Ask the AI for general info , if partial data is available (e.g., just the drug name but no structured DB entry). If some partial data is still captured—such as just the name but not dosage—PharmaLens can still send a fallback prompt to Gemma 3n , asking it to analyze based on general knowledge. For example: “User scanned: Acemetacin. No local data found. What is it used for? Risks?” This fallback allows the app to provide value even beyond its local drug DB, while maintaining transparency about data limitations. Over time, you can also update the database to include more drugs based on usage patterns."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Can PharmaLens alert me if a medicine is expired?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Answer: Yes, one of the valuable safety features of PharmaLens is its ability to detect expired medicines and warn the user immediately. When you scan a pill strip or prescription, the app's OCR engine looks for expiration dates printed on the packaging. If an expiry date is found, PharmaLens compares it with the device’s current date and displays an alert if the medicine is expired or close to expiring. The alert will typically say something like: “ ⚠ This medicine expired on 03/2023. Do not use it unless advised by a medical professional.” For medicines with just a few days left until expiration, the system also flags a “use with caution” status, encouraging users to double-check before consumption. This feature is crucial because many people, especially in rural areas or during emergencies, end up using leftover medicines from old kits. Sometimes expiry dates are partially faded or ignored. PharmaLens acts as a safety net by scanning the strip in real-time and flagging potential health risks due to expired compounds. Even if the app cannot fully detect the date due to damage or missing text, it will prompt the user to confirm it manually—ensuring that expiry checks are never skipped unintentionally. This simple but powerful addition can prevent poisoning, reduced efficacy, or complications from degraded medicine—and it works entirely offline."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "10. Does the app support barcode scanning on packaging?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Answer: Currently, PharmaLens does not support barcode or QR code scanning—but this feature is actively in development for a future version. The goal is to enable users to scan the printed barcode or QR code often found on medicine boxes, which can provide faster and more accurate identification of drugs. Once implemented, barcode scanning will serve as an alternative or backup to OCR (optical character recognition). This is especially helpful in environments where the label is hard to read, or when text is too small or faded. By scanning the code, the app will instantly fetch the drug’s generic name, manufacturer, dosage, expiry, and batch number from a locally stored registry. Pharmacists, hospitals, and telemedicine platforms will benefit greatly from this feature. It will streamline workflow, ensure more precise drug matching, and help maintain consistency in stock tracking or prescription verification. Unlike many cloud-dependent barcode apps, PharmaLens will use an offline medicine barcode database , making it usable in areas with poor or no connectivity. Users won’t need to be online to benefit from this feature. While OCR will remain the default mode for the average user, barcode scanning will offer a fast, frictionless experience for professionals and power users."}]}

Once uploaded, PharmaLens automatically processes the image through its offline OCR engine and AI-powered drug safety checker."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How does PharmaLens handle generic vs. brand names?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Answer: PharmaLens understands that many medicines are sold under different brand names, even though they contain the same active ingredients. To solve this, the app maintains an internal mapping between brand names (e.g., “Calpol”) and their corresponding generic drugs (e.g., “Paracetamol”). When you scan a label or type a drug name, PharmaLens cross-checks it with both brand and generic entries in its local database. If you enter or scan a brand name, the app automatically links it to its generic counterpart and runs all safety checks based on that. This helps eliminate confusion and ensures that risk warnings are accurate and consistent. This feature is particularly useful in India where the same drug can be sold by dozens of companies under slightly different brand names. It also helps users understand what they’re actually taking, especially when switching between pharmacies. Future updates will allow users to search by manufacturer, filter by category, and see all equivalent brand-generic pairs. With this brand-to-generic conversion, PharmaLens becomes not just a safety checker—but also an educational tool for smarter healthcare choices."}]}

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "6. What if I scan a damaged or partially torn label?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Answer: If you scan a damaged, torn, or faded label, PharmaLens applies advanced image preprocessing techniques to salvage as much information as possible. The app enhances the input image using filters like grayscale conversion, noise removal, brightness correction, and thresholding. These techniques help make faint text more legible to the OCR system. Once the image is processed, the app attempts to extract medicine names and dosages from the visible sections. If parts of the text are missing or distorted, PharmaLens uses fuzzy string matching against its local drug database to suggest the most likely matches. For instance, if only “Para…” is detected, it may suggest “Paracetamol” as a potential match. You also have the option to manually fill in missing details or correct partial outputs. This hybrid approach ensures that users aren’t blocked by imperfect conditions—such as when labels get wet, scratched, or folded. PharmaLens is built for real-world use, not lab conditions. It understands that most medicine packages won't be scanned in perfect lighting or straight alignment. Its intelligent recovery mechanisms ensure users still get meaningful, safe, and actionable insights—even from less-than-perfect scans."}]}

First, you’ll be prompted to check the spelling and try manual input—this is useful in case the OCR misread the label. If it's a new or uncommon brand, the app might ask if you want to associate it with a known generic medicine. This helps in cases where a newer brand is just a variation of an existing drug. PharmaLens also allows users to submit unknown medicine names to a pending review list (offline for now, but cloud support is planned), which helps our team improve the database over time. As more users report rare or new entries, they will be added to the next update. In the meantime, users can manually enter known components or ingredients from the packaging to get partial safety reports. Even if full details aren't available, the system still tries to offer guidance based on what’s entered. So, even if a medicine isn't recognized immediately, PharmaLens doesn't leave you hanging.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How does PharmaLens check for drug interactions?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "PharmaLens checks for drug interactions using a combination of local rule-based logic and AI-powered reasoning via the embedded Gemma 3n model. Here’s how it works: When a user scans or inputs a medicine, PharmaLens not only identifies the drug and its dosage but also keeps track of previously scanned or logged medicines (stored locally). Then, the app checks for potential conflicts by referencing an offline interaction matrix —a curated dataset that lists known risky drug combinations, such as “Paracetamol + Alcohol” or “Ibuprofen + Aspirin.” If a scanned drug matches an entry in this matrix, the app flags it with a warning. But the real strength comes from the AI layer. PharmaLens prompts Gemma 3n with a structured query like: “The user is taking Drug A and Drug B. Are there any risks or contraindications?” Gemma responds with plain-language advice based on known pharmacological behavior, side effects, and user conditions (e.g., liver disease, elderly age). The interaction logic is displayed to the user using a color-coded warning system: ● ✅ Safe ● ⚠ Caution ● ❌ Dangerous This dual approach—local rule-checking + AI interpretation—ensures both speed and depth. It gives users accurate interaction feedback even offline, while accounting for real-world complexities like age or health history, making PharmaLens a trusted safety companion."}]}

It enables users to interact with the app using their voice instead of tapping or typing, making the experience more natural and inclusive. Using speech recognition, users can speak the name of a medicine they want to verify. PharmaLens will process the input offline, convert the spoken words into text, and then proceed through its usual safety checking flow: fuzzy match the name, cross-reference the local drug database, and prompt Gemma 3n to generate warnings, dosage info, and interaction risks. Once the results are ready, the app can also read the response aloud using a text-to-speech system, available in multiple languages like Hindi, Tamil, or Marathi—making it helpful for users who may not be fluent in English. This voice mode complements the image-based workflow and doesn’t replace it. It is particularly helpful in cases where scanning is difficult or the medicine strip is unlabelled but the user remembers the name.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Can PharmaLens detect expiry dates or dosages?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yes, PharmaLens is capable of detecting both dosage information and expiry dates from scanned medicine images, thanks to its built-in OCR engine and preprocessing logic. When a user uploads a photo of a pill strip or label, the system extracts all visible text fields—this typically includes the drug name , strength (e.g., 500 mg) , batch number , and expiry date (e.g., EXP 08/2025) . The OCR module uses layout detection and regular expression patterns to isolate numeric dosage values and standard date formats. For example, if it sees \"Paracetamol 500mg EXP: 06/24,\" it parses both pieces and includes them in the structured result. Once dosage is extracted, the system checks it against the local drug database to verify whether it’s within safe limits. If the dosage seems too high or doesn’t match the standard for that drug, Gemma 3n is prompted with a warning-check query like: “User input: Paracetamol 1500mg. Is this safe?” For expiry dates, if the current device date indicates that the medicine is expired, the app shows a warning like: “ ⚠ This medicine may be expired. Please check packaging carefully before use.” This helps users avoid using ineffective or potentially harmful medications. While detection depends on label clarity, the system handles most standard print formats well—and does all this offline, right on the device."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "15. Does PharmaLens work on low-end phones?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yes! PharmaLens is optimized for lightweight performance and works smoothly even on older smartphones with limited RAM and processing power.

Whether you’re a solo pharmacist in a remote town or a nurse in a city hospital, PharmaLens can become an instant second opinion, helping reduce human error and boosting patient safety in real-world clinical environments."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Can PharmaLens check for drug interactions?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Answer: Yes, checking for drug-drug interactions is one of PharmaLens' core features. When you scan multiple medicines together—either in one batch or one by one—the system not only identifies each drug but also analyzes how they may interact with one another inside the body. These interactions are flagged based on known conflict pairs in its offline safety rules database. For instance, if you scan both “Paracetamol” and “Ibuprofen,” the app will likely say it’s okay in limited doses. But if you scan “Warfarin” and “Aspirin,” the system may raise a red alert due to bleeding risks. Interaction warnings are color-coded for clarity: green (safe), yellow (use caution), and red (dangerous). The explanation includes what type of interaction is expected—like overlapping side effects, metabolic interference, or increased toxicity. This feature is particularly useful for patients with chronic conditions who take multiple drugs daily. It can also help avoid unnecessary visits to a doctor for basic cross-checking. Even over-the-counter drugs are included in the interaction system, making it helpful for self-medicating users too. And remember—this all works offline. No data is sent to a server, and no internet is needed for interaction analysis. You get safety at your fingertips, in real-time."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "22. Does PharmaLens detect dosage errors?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Answer: Yes, PharmaLens includes logic to detect potential dosage issues based on the scanned or typed medicine label. If you enter or scan a dosage that appears too high or too low for a standard adult, child, or elderly user, the app will raise a yellow or red flag depending on the severity. For example, if a label says “Paracetamol 1000mg 3 times a day,” PharmaLens may warn you that the total daily dosage exceeds the typical safe limit. Similarly, if you enter “Amoxicillin 125mg for an adult,” the app may suggest confirming the dosage, as it appears low for a typical adult treatment course. These alerts are based on general-purpose dosing guidelines sourced from publicly available medical literature and drug databases. They're meant to serve as a pre-check —not a substitute for professional advice. The system is especially helpful for parents administering pediatric doses or elderly patients managing multiple medications. In such cases, incorrect dosages can have serious consequences, and a simple nudge from the app can make all the difference. In future versions, PharmaLens will allow users to input age, weight, and other factors to get more personalized dose guidance.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "1. Can PharmaLens detect and warn about duplicate medicine scans?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Answer: Yes, PharmaLens has built-in functionality to detect and warn users about duplicate medicine scans. When you scan a pill strip or upload a prescription image, the app stores the details locally in a private log on your device. If the same drug is scanned again within a short timeframe—especially if it includes the same dosage or batch—the system will flag it as a potential duplicate. This is particularly useful for people managing multiple medications or elderly users who may forget what they've taken. The alert typically says something like: “You’ve already scanned Paracetamol 500mg today. Please check if you’ve taken this dose.” This feature helps prevent overdosing and reinforces medication safety without overwhelming the user with technical details. All of this happens completely offline—your scan history never leaves your device. You can view or clear it at any time from the app settings. In future updates, PharmaLens will also let you label certain scans as ‘taken’ or ‘not taken’ to better track your medicine schedule. Duplicate detection, alongside interaction checks and dosage alerts, forms a core part of PharmaLens’ mission to empower safe, smart medicine use—especially in regions with limited healthcare access or digital literacy."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Question: Is PharmaLens fully offline, or does it need an internet connection?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Answer: PharmaLens is designed to be 100% offline , ensuring complete accessibility and privacy for users regardless of their location or internet availability. From the moment a user opens the app to the final drug safety result, every process—including image scanning, OCR text extraction, fuzzy matching, and even AI-based reasoning with Gemma 3n—runs entirely on the device. There are no server calls, no cloud-based processing, and no data uploads. This offline-first approach is particularly crucial for rural areas, disaster zones, or communities where consistent connectivity is a challenge. It also ensures that users retain full control over their health data, as nothing leaves their device. To make this possible, PharmaLens includes: ● An embedded drug database (stored as a local JSON or SQLite file). ● An on-device OCR module (Tesseract or DeepOCR). ● Integration with Gemma 3n via Ollama , allowing the LLM to run locally using lightweight system resources. The result? Users get near-instant, AI-powered medicine safety analysis without needing Wi-Fi or mobile data . This makes PharmaLens not just convenient but also a dependable health tool in low-resource settings."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Can I see a history of my uploads and results?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yes, PharmaLens offers an optional local scan history feature that allows you to view previously scanned medicines and their safety results. This feature is entirely offline and privacy-focused—meaning your history is stored only on your device , never sent to any cloud server or external database. If enabled, each successful scan logs basic information such as: ● 📅 Date and time of the scan ● 💊 Medicine name and dosage ● ⚠ Result status (Safe / Caution / Dangerous) ● 📝 Short summary of the AI’s safety recommendation This can be useful for users managing multiple medications, caregivers keeping track of elder patients, or simply for reviewing past interactions. However, the image files are not saved unless you choose to do so manually, to preserve privacy. You can clear or disable scan history at any time from the settings menu, giving you full control over your data. This local log also powers the interaction checker , allowing the app to warn you if a new medicine could react dangerously with something you scanned earlier."}]}

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Question: What can the PharmaLens chatbot help me with?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Answer: The PharmaLens chatbot is designed to act as an intelligent, offline health assistant that provides clear, human-like guidance related to medicines and their safe use. Its primary role is to explain drug information in plain language based on user inputs such as scanned labels, typed medicine names, or spoken commands. Here’s what the chatbot can help with: ● ✅ Explain a medicine’s purpose (e.g., \"What is Paracetamol used for?\") ● 📏 Clarify correct dosage based on general health guidelines. ● ⚠ Warn about common side effects , overdose risks, and misuse. ● 💥 Flag dangerous drug interactions based on your scan history or combined inputs. ● 👵 Provide safety advice for vulnerable groups like elderly patients, pregnant individuals, or those with liver/kidney issues. The chatbot is also capable of handling multi-turn conversations , such as: “Is it safe to take Paracetamol with Ibuprofen?” “What if I have liver disease?” “What’s the max daily dose?” It does not replace professional medical guidance but serves as a safety net, especially in settings with limited healthcare access. All responses are generated locally and personalized based on your inputs and the offline drug database."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Question: What if a medicine is not found in the database?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Answer: If a medicine scanned through PharmaLens is not found in the local database, the app will gracefully handle the case by informing the user that the drug is unrecognized and offering next steps. The system is designed to never leave the user guessing or at risk. First, if the OCR result does not match any entries in the local database (even after fuzzy matching), the app will return a message like: “This medicine is not in our local database. Please double-check the image or try scanning again.” The user will then be given options to: ● 🔁 Rescan the image , in case of OCR error. ● 📝 Manually enter the drug name , for advanced users. ● 📤 Ask the AI for general info , if partial data is available (e.g., just the drug name but no structured DB entry). If some partial data is still captured—such as just the name but not dosage—PharmaLens can still send a fallback prompt to Gemma 3n , asking it to analyze based on general knowledge. For example: “User scanned: Acemetacin. No local data found. What is it used for? Risks?” This fallback allows the app to provide value even beyond its local drug DB, while maintaining transparency about data limitations. Over time, you can also update the database to include more drugs based on usage patterns."}]}

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What formats of prescriptions or images are supported?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "PharmaLens is built to be flexible and user-friendly, supporting all common image file formats including JPEG (.jpg/.jpeg) , PNG (.png) , and BMP (.bmp) . Whether you're uploading a smartphone photo of a blister strip, a scanned prescription from a clinic, or a clear photo of a medicine label, the app can process it effectively. The key requirement is that the image contains printed text (not handwritten), such as the drug name, dosage, or manufacturer info. The built-in OCR module works best when the text is in standard fonts and moderately clear, even if captured in suboptimal conditions like dim lighting or background noise. While handwriting recognition is not currently supported, we’ve optimized the pipeline to handle noisy, skewed, or slightly blurred images through preprocessing steps such as grayscale conversion, thresholding, and resizing. PharmaLens does not impose strict file size limits, and you don’t need to crop or modify the image before uploading. The app is designed to do the heavy lifting—making it accessible for users who may not be tech-savvy but need accurate medication recognition and safety information fast. Future versions may include support for PDFs or integrated prescription records, but for now, all major image types used in real-world healthcare contexts are fully supported."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Is my medical data shared with third parties?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Absolutely not. PharmaLens does not share, transmit, or sell any medical data to third parties—because it never even collects it in the first place. Unlike many health apps that rely on cloud services or background analytics, PharmaLens operates in strict offline mode , meaning no internet connection is required and no data ever leaves your device. There are no tracking scripts, advertising SDKs, or analytics integrations bundled into the app. We don’t ask for your phone number, email, or identity, and we don’t track your location, scan history, or device behavior. Even your scan results are processed and stored locally, only if you explicitly enable the scan log feature. This design was intentional. PharmaLens was built for communities where privacy is critical—whether due to medical sensitivity, rural access constraints, or shared device environments. Even if someone were to access your phone, there would be no record of your interactions unless you chose to save them. We adhere to a zero-data philosophy: no collection = no sharing = no risk . Your health data belongs to you, and PharmaLens makes sure it stays that way."}]}

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Can I batch scan multiple pills together?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Answer: Yes, PharmaLens supports batch scanning, which means you can scan multiple pill strips or medicine boxes in a single image. This feature is especially useful for caregivers, hospital staff, or anyone managing several medications at once. When you upload or capture an image with multiple medicine labels, the system intelligently segments the image and extracts text from each distinct label area using multi-region OCR. Once it has identified all visible drug names, PharmaLens processes each one through its internal database and AI model. You receive an individual safety report for each medicine as well as an overall drug-drug interaction report across all the scanned items. This helps users avoid dangerous combinations and better understand potential side effects from taking multiple drugs together. Batch scanning saves time and ensures more efficient health management, particularly for users who take medications daily or are caring for elderly patients or children. All this happens offline, ensuring fast results without relying on cloud servers or data uploads. In future versions, batch scanning will be further optimized with support for horizontal strip orientation and manual correction in case a label is misread or omitted. With this feature, PharmaLens becomes more than just a single-drug checker—it becomes a comprehensive multi-medicine safety assistant."}]}

It enables users to interact with the app using their voice instead of tapping or typing, making the experience more natural and inclusive. Using speech recognition, users can speak the name of a medicine they want to verify. PharmaLens will process the input offline, convert the spoken words into text, and then proceed through its usual safety checking flow: fuzzy match the name, cross-reference the local drug database, and prompt Gemma 3n to generate warnings, dosage info, and interaction risks. Once the results are ready, the app can also read the response aloud using a text-to-speech system, available in multiple languages like Hindi, Tamil, or Marathi—making it helpful for users who may not be fluent in English. This voice mode complements the image-based workflow and doesn’t replace it. It is particularly helpful in cases where scanning is difficult or the medicine strip is unlabelled but the user remembers the name.
